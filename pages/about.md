<h1 style="display:none;">Arthur Clerjon – Researcher in Energy Systems Modeling, Decarbonation of power systems</h1>


#### Welcome to my personal website!



I am a **permanent research scientist** at [**CEA Grenoble**](https://www.cea.fr/english/Pages/energy/energy.aspx), working on energy systems modelling.


I am particularly focusing on the analyses of  electricity **system flexibility**—how **power grids** can remain balanced as we scale up **intermittent renewables** and **electrify** key sectors such as **heating** and **transport**.

I am currently developing **integrated approaches** to energy planning as part of the [**EQUALS – Global Equitable Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources**](/projects/equals) project, which explores how to **optimaly** deploy low-carbon technologies across the world based on **climate**, **energy uses** and **territorial specificities**.

One of my research ambition is to understand and model trade-offs between **technologies**, **resource availability**, and **local needs**, in order to help design **realistic** energy transition pathways.

I am also committed to knowledge sharing—through [teaching](/teaching), research supervision, and public engagement.

## What I work on

You can find here some examples of my research projects:

- Modeling the **[flexibility needs of electric power systems](/projects/energy-system-flexibility)**
- Reducing emissions from **[heating systems](/projects/heat-decarbonization)** (~30% of national GHG emissions)  
- Supporting the electrification of **[road transport](/projects/transport-decarbonization)** (~15% of national GHG emissions)  


I strongly believe that in order to meet the challenges of energy transition and decarbonization of the economy while respecting planetary boundaries and societal thresholds, it is necessary to bridge the gap between technical sciences and social sciences, combining technical optimums, territorial specificities, and economic and political contexts.
It is in this spirit that I initiated the interdisciplinary research project **[EQUALS – Global Equitable Allocation of Renewable Energy Sources](/projects/equals)**, funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR).
